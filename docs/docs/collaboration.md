# Collaboration

To collaborate with others, add them as collaborators in Posit Connect. During
publishing, they should provide their API key and will be able to choose a
content location to publish to if the notebook title is the same.

Additionally, you may share notebooks if appropriate.

For additional information, please see the [Collaboration](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/publishing/#publishing-collaboration) section of the Posit Connect User Guide.
